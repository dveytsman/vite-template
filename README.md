# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
I created this because of the vulnerabilities of using create-react-app

## How to create your own vite + react application

1. In the terminal, specifically where you would like your project to be, run the command `npm create vite@latest`
2. Name your project, this will be the name of the folder you are working in.
3. Select the framework you would like to use. This project is using react.
4. Choose what scripting language you want Typescript or Javascript.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
